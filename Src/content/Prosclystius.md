# Prosclystius
This is a little project I worked on to learn some rust programming. It partially works, I intend on returning to this at somepoint.

# What is it?

An experimental WFC solver for usage with Unity & potentially unreal. Multiple implementations (Rust, Unity c# burst, etc) will be created over the duration of this project. 

# Current WIP UI
